Waveform
========

Waveform is a class to generate waveform images from audio files. You can combine it with jPlayer to make a soundcloud.com style MP3 player. It also comes with a handy CLI you can use to generate waveform images on the command line.

Installation
============

Waveform depends on `ruby-audio`, which in turn depends on libsndfile.

Build libsndfile from (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/), install it via `apt` (`sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev`), `libsndfile` in macports, etc...

Then:

    $ sudo gem install waveform

Image creation depends on `chunky_png`, which has a faster native library called `oily_png` which will be used if available.

    $ sudo gem install oily_png

NOTE: If `ruby-audio` fails to compile and you have `libsndfile` available, it may be because of this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19919640/ruby-audio-1-6-1-install-error-with-installed-libsndfile-1-0-25

CLI Usage
=========

    $ waveform song.wav waveform.png

There are some nifty options you can supply to switch things up:

    -W sets the width (in pixels) of the waveform image.
    -H sets the height (in pixels).
    -c sets the color used to draw the waveform (in hex, can also use
        'transparent').
    -b sets the background color to draw the waveform on (in hex, and can use
        'transparent' as well).
    -m sets the method used to sample the source audio file, it can either be
        'peak' or 'rms'. 'peak' is probably what you want because it looks
        cooler, but 'rms' is closer to what you actually hear.
    -s sets the method used to retrieve samples of audio file, it can either be
        'read' or an array of points within -1..1 range. 'read' is default and samples
        from the audio file provided as indicated by the method given in -m
    -t sets the type of waveform to render, it can either be 'audio' or 'phonocardiogram'.
       'audio' is default and commonly seen on sites that play music: example of an audio wave http://www.bza.biz/indexhibit/files/gimgs/waveform.gif)
       'phonocardiogram' is specific to heartbeats example: http://www.stethographics.com/newimages/products/phono/murmur.jpg
       The core difference between th two is audio plots the absolute value of a sample point
       and mirrors it, while the phonocardiogram maintains the original value and does not mirror.


There are also some less-nifty options:

    -q will generate your waveform without printing out a bunch of stuff.
    -h will print out a help screen with all this info.
    -F will automatically overwrite destination file.

Generating a small waveform "cut out" of a white background is pretty useful,
then you can overlay it on a web-gradient on the website for your new startup
and it will look really cool. To make it you could use:

    $ waveform -W900 -H140 -ctransparent -b#ffffff Motley\ Cr√ºe/Kickstart\ my\ Heart.wav sweet_waveforms/Kickstart\ my\ Heart.png

Usage in code
=============

The CLI is really just a thin wrapper around the Waveform class, which you can also use in your programs for reasons I haven't thought of. The Waveform class takes pretty much the same options as the CLI when generating waveforms.

Requirements
============

`ruby-audio`

The gem version, *not* the old outdated library listed on RAA. `ruby-audio` is a wrapper for `libsndfile`, on my Ubuntu 10.04LTS VM I installed the necessary libs to build `ruby-audio` via: `sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev`.

`chunky_png`

`chunky_png` is a pure ruby (!) PNG manipulation library. Caveat to this requirement is that if you also install `oily_png` you will get *better performance* as it uses some C code, and C code is fast.

Converting MP3 to WAV
=====================

Waveform used to (very thinly) wrap ffmpeg to convert MP3 (and whatever other format) to WAV audio before processing the WAV and generating the waveform image. It seemed a bit presumptious for Waveform to handle that, especially since you might want to use your own conversion options (i.e. downsampling the bitrate to generate waveforms faster, etc...).

If you happen to be using ffmpeg, you can easily convert MP3 to WAV via:

    ffmpeg -i "/path/to/source/file.mp3" -f wav "/path/to/output/file.wav"

Tests
=====

    $ rake

If you get an error about not being able to find ruby-audio gem (and you have ruby-audio gem) you might need to let rake know how to load your gems -- if you're using rubygems:

    $ export RUBYOPT="rubygems"
    $ rake

Sample sound file used in tests is in the Public Domain from soundbible.com: <http://soundbible.com/1598-Electronic-Chime.html>.

Changes
=======

0.1.3
-----
  * Update for ruby 3.2 (replace `File.exists?` w/ `File.exist?`)

0.1.2
-----
  * Added more helpful deprecation notice for non-WAV audio files

0.1.1
-----
  * Fixed RMS calculation (was calculating RMSD instead of RMS before) -- thanks, cviedmai

0.1.0
-----
  * No more wrapping ffmpeg to automatically convert mp3 to wav
  * Fixed support for mono audio sources (4-channel, surround, etc. should also work)
  * Change to gemspec & added seperate version file so that bundler won't try to load ruby-audio (thanks, amiel)
  * Changed Waveform-class API as there's no longer a need to instantiate a waveform
